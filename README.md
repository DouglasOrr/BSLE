# Byte Stream Learning Environment (BSLE)

Write RL agents and games that communicate using byte streams.


## Developing BSLE

We use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), after installing that:

```bash
poetry install
poetry run jupyter-lab
```


## About BSLE

BSLE is intended to be a simple and fun learning environment for playing with deep RL techniques.
